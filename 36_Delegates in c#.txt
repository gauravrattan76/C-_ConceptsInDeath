36_Delegates in c#-
***************************************
1.delegates are type safe function providers.
2.they hold a reference to a function or we can say that pointer to a function.
3.Signature of a delegate should match to that of the fuction otherwise we get the compile tim error.
4.its simlar to a class we can create instance of it and then we can pass the function name as a parameter that is the function it points too.


**************************************************
Code-


using System;

public delegate void Mydelegate(string text);//delegate are type safe as its hould match the method signature
class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Mydelegate md = new Mydelegate(Print);//creating instance of the delegate
        md("Gaurav Rattan");//passing value to the delegate
    }

    public static void Print(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(message);
    }

}
