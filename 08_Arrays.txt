8_Arrays-


int[] evennumbers = new int[3];
evennumbers[0]=1;
evennumbers[1]=2;
evennumbers[2]=3;

***********************************

int[] evennumbers = {1,2,3,4}


************************************************
Advantages-
Are strongly typed.
means that we cant assign string to that array now.


Disadvantage-

Array can not grow in siw when initialised.
have to rely on integral indices to get the itm.
