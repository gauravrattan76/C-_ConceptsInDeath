23_Polymorphism-

Basis of polymorphism-

A base class reference variable can point to child class object.

Definition of polyphormism-
enable us to invoke derived class methods using base class reference variables at run time.
Allows us to invoke derived class methods usinf base class reference variables at run time.
 in base class method is declared as virtual and we over ride the method in derived class.
Virtual keyword means that the method can be overriden at run time.

*********************************
Code-

using System;

class Employee
{
    public string fname = "Gaurav";
    public string lname = "Rattan";
    public virtual void printfullname()//use virtual with the class name in the base class
    {
        Console.WriteLine(fname + "  " + lname);
    }
}

class Pemployee : Employee
{
    public override void printfullname()//overrides the method in the base class
    {
        Console.WriteLine(fname + "  " + lname + "Permanent Employee");
    }
}

class Temployee : Employee
{
    public override void printfullname()//overrides the method in the base class at run time.
    {
        Console.WriteLine(fname + "  " + lname + "Temporary Employee");
    }
}

class Oemployee : Employee
{
    
}

class program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Employee emp = new Pemployee();
        emp.printfullname();

        Employee emp1 = new Temployee();
        emp1.printfullname();

        Employee emp2 = new Oemployee();
        emp2.printfullname();//we get the base class methods
    }
}
