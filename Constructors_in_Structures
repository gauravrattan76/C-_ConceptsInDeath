public struct Rational

    private long numerator;
    private long denominator;

    public Rational(long num, long denom)
    { /* Todo: Find GCD etc. */ }

    public Rational(long num)
    {
        numerator = num;
        denominator = 1;
    }

    public Rational() // This is not allowed

}

Or the big reason is that a structure is a value type and value types are initialized by a default value and the constructor is used for initialization.

You don't have to instantiate your struct with the new keyword. It instead works like an int; you can directly access it.

Structs cannot contain explicit parameterless constructors. Struct members are automatically initialized to their default values.
